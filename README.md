# Preparing the application
This repository contains several scripts that can be used independently of each other. 
Before running them, make sure that you have the necessary requirements installed. 

## Install required libraries

- Python 3.6
- Tensorflow 1.8.0 (or optionally tensorflow-gpu 1.8.0)
- pycocotools (more [infos](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/issues/6#issuecomment-341503509))
    - On Linux, run `pip install git+https://github.com/waleedka/cocoapi.git#egg=pycocotools&subdirectory=PythonAPI`
    - On Windows, run `pip install git+https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.git#egg=pycocotools^&subdirectory=PythonAPI`
- Some libraries, as specified in [requirements.txt](MusicObjectDetector/requirements.txt)

## Build Protobuf files on Linux

```commandline
cd research
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
```

## Build Protobuf files on Windows

> Run [`DownloadAndBuildProtocolBuffers.ps1`](MusicObjectDetector/DownloadAndBuildProtocolBuffers.ps1) to automate this step or manually build the protobufs by first installing [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads) and then run:

```commandline
cd research
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
```

Note, that you have to use [version 3.4.0](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v3.4.0/) because of a [bug in 3.5.0 and 3.5.1](https://github.com/google/protobuf/issues/3957)

# Dataset

> Run [`PrepareDatasetsForTensorflow.ps1`](MusicObjectDetector/PrepareDatasetsForTensorflow.ps1) to automate this step on Windows or manually prepare the datasets with the following steps (on Linux).

Run the following scripts to reproduce the dataset locally:

```
# cd into MusicObjectDetector folder
python download_muscima_dataset.py
python prepare_muscima_annotations.py
python dataset_splitter.py --source_directory=data/muscima_pp_cropped_images_with_stafflines --destination_directory=data/training_validation_test_with_stafflines
```
  
These scripts will download the datasets automatically, prepare the annotations and split the images into three reproducible parts for training, validation and test. 

Now you can create the Tensorflow Records that are required for actually running the training.

```
python create_muscima_tf_record.py --data_dir=data/training_validation_test_with_stafflines --set=training --annotations_dir=Annotations --output_path=data/all_classes_with_staff_lines_writer_independent_split/training.record --label_map_path=mapping_all_classes.txt
python create_muscima_tf_record.py --data_dir=data/training_validation_test_with_stafflines --set=validation --annotations_dir=Annotations --output_path=data/all_classes_with_staff_lines_writer_independent_split/validation.record --label_map_path=mapping_all_classes.txt
python create_muscima_tf_record.py --data_dir=data/training_validation_test_with_stafflines --set=test --annotations_dir=Annotations --output_path=data/all_classes_with_staff_lines_writer_independent_split/test.record --label_map_path=mapping_all_classes.txt
```

 By providing a different mapping, you can reduce the classes, you want to be able to detect, e.g. `mapping_71_classes.txt`:
 
# Running the training

## Adding source to Python path
Make sure you have all required folders appended to the [Python path](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md#add-libraries-to-pythonpath)

For Linux:
```bash
# From tensorflow/models/research/
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim
```

For Windows (Powershell):
```powershell
$pathToGitRoot = "[GIT_ROOT]"
$pathToSourceRoot = "$($pathToGitRoot)/object_detection"
$env:PYTHONPATH = "$($pathToGitRoot);$($pathToSourceRoot);$($pathToGitRoot)/slim"
```

## Adjusting paths
For running the training, you need to change the paths, according to your system

- in the configuration, you want to run, e.g. `configurations/faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_muscima_pretrained_reduced_classes.config`
- if you use them, in the PowerShell scripts in the `training_scripts` folder.

Run the actual training script, by using the pre-defined Powershell scripts in the `training_scripts` folder, or by directly calling

```
# Start the training
python [GIT_ROOT]/research/object_detection/train.py --logtostderr --pipeline_config_path="[GIT_ROOT]/MusicObjectDetector/configurations/[SELECTED_CONFIG].config" --train_dir="[GIT_ROOT]/MusicObjectDetector/data/checkpoints-[SELECTED_CONFIG]-train"

# Start the validation
python [GIT_ROOT]/research/object_detection/eval.py --logtostderr --pipeline_config_path="[GIT_ROOT]/MusicObjectDetector/configurations/[SELECTED_CONFIG].config" --checkpoint_dir="[GIT_ROOT]/MusicObjectDetector/data/checkpoints-[SELECTED_CONFIG]-train" --eval_dir="[GIT_ROOT]/MusicObjectDetector/data/checkpoints-[SELECTED_CONFIG]-validate"
```

A few remarks: The two scripts can and should be run at the same time, to get a live evaluation during the training. The values, may be visualized by calling `tensorboard --logdir=[GIT_ROOT]/MusicObjectDetector/data`.

## Restricting GPU memory usage

Notice that usually Tensorflow allocates the entire memory of your graphics card for the training. In order to run both training and validation at the same time, you might have to restrict Tensorflow from doing so, by opening `train.py` and `eval.py` and uncomment the respective (prepared) lines in the main function. E.g.:

```
gpu_options = tf.GPUOptions(per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=0.3)
sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(gpu_options=gpu_options))
```

## Training with pre-trained weights

It is recommended that you use pre-trained weights for known networks to speed up training and improve overall results. To do so, head over to the [Tensorflow detection model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md), download and unzip the respective trained model, e.g. `faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_coco` for reproducing the best results, we obtained. The path to the unzipped files, must be specified inside of the configuration in the `train_config`-section, e.g.

```
train-config: {
  fine_tune_checkpoint: "C:/Users/Alex/Repositories/MusicObjectDetector-TF/MusicObjectDetector/data/faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_coco_2017_11_08/model.ckpt"
  from_detection_checkpoint: true
}
```

> Note that inside that folder, there is no actual file, called `model.ckpt`, but multiple files called `model.ckpt.[something]`.

## Dimension clustering

For optimizing the performance of the detector, we adopted the dimensions clustering algorithm, proposed in the [YOLO 9000 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242).
While preparing the dataset, the `muscima_image_cutter.py` script created a file called `Annotations.csv` and a folder called `Annotations`. 
Both will contain the same annotations, but in different formats. While the csv-file contains all annotations in a plain list, the Annotations
folder contains one xml-file per image, complying with the format used for the [Pascal VOC project](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/).

To perform dimension clustering on the cropped images, run the following scripts:
```
python generate_muscima_statistics.py
python muscima_dimension_clustering.py
```
The first script will load all annotations and create four csv-files containing the dimensions for each annotation 
from all images, including their relative sizes, compared to the entire image.
The second script loads those statistics and performs dimension clustering, use a k-means algorithm on the relative 
dimensions of annotations.   

# Inference

## Standalone inference

We recommend to check out the [demo](MusicObjectDetector/demo) folder first, which provides a self-contained script for performing  object detection and does not depend on this library. It comes with a pre-trained model for convenience and a simple text output for interoperability with other applications.

## Inference from within this library
If you have trained a model by yourself, [this document](research/object_detection/g3doc/exporting_models.md) describes how to prepare it. Basically, you just run `export_inference_graph.py` with appropriate arguments or `freeze_model.ps1` after setting the paths accordingly. Alternatively, a pre-trained model can be download from here: [2018-05-15_faster-rcnn_inception-resnet-v2_2000-proposals_full-page-detection_muscima-pp.pb](https://owncloud.tuwien.ac.at/index.php/s/5J1c8yhnVXB6Sm2/download). 


Once you have the frozen model, you can perform inference on a single image by running

```bash
# From [GIT_ROOT]/MusicObjectDetection
python inference_over_image.py \
    --inference_graph ${frozen_inference_graph.pb} \
    --label_map mapping.txt \
    --input_image ${IMAGE_TO_BE_CLASSIFIED} \
    --output_image image_with_detection.jpg
```

or for an entire directory of images by running

```bash
# From [GIT_ROOT]/MusicObjectDetection
python inference_over_directory.py \
    --inference_graph ${frozen_inference_graph.pb} \ 
    --label_map mapping.txt \
    --input_directory ${DIRECTORY_TO_IMAGES} \
    --output_directory ${OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}
```
